MIPS Simulator for Computer Architecture project Spring 14
This project creates a simple MIPS simulator which performs the following two tasks:

-    Load  a  specified  MIPS  text  file and  generate  the  assembly  code  equivalent  to  the  input  file  (disassembler). Please see the sample input file and disassembly output. 

-   Generate  the  instruction-by-instruction  simulation  of  the  MIPS  code  (simulator).  It  should  also  produce/print  the contents of  registers  and  data memories  after execution of each instruction.  Please see  the sample simulation output file.
